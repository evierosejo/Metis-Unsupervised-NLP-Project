# Understanding Trends in U.S. Supreme Court Opinions 

## Question:
I will be investigating U.S. Supreme Court opinions from 1968 to 2021 to understand how the changing makeup and sentiment of the court has affected the highest court's rulings over time and to determine whether the Supreme Court is the non-partisan entity it was designed to be.  By using opinions from this time period, I can hone in on the modern political context, namely from the beginning of the Sixth Party System era to today, which is characterized by the deepening ideological division between Democrats and Republicans and the emergence of new voter coalitions, such as the "religious right". 

## Data:
I plan to use U.S. Supreme Court opinions from 1968 to 2021 from [FindLaw](https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court). If time permits, I would also like to supplement the text data with data for each opinion on the Justices residing when the opinion was made, the number of justices who concurred, the number of justices who dissented, etc. to construct a more detailed picture of the court at the time of the opinion.

## Tools:
I intend to use the following tools during the course of this project:
* BeautifulSoup and Selenium for acquiring raw data 
* NLTK and spaCy for text preprocessing 
* Sklearn for text processing, topic mode
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing 

## MVP:
The goal for my MVP will to have a my data acquired via web-scraping and preprocessed with a topic modeling technique applied.
